this is a readme file for 0x02-functions_nested_loops




TIPS:
when you gcc (for the 1st task) all the file that will be involvced has to be mentioned like 
normally gcc is like this right: gcc file.c  or gcc file.c -o outputname  so

gcc _putchar.c 0-putchar.c -o 0-putchar
gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 _putchar.c 0-putchar.c -o 0-putchar // when we add all the warings
